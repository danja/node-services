### app.js Explanation

#### Operation Breakdown

1. **Imports and Configuration**:

   - Imports necessary modules (`express`, `body-parser`, `express-session`, `passport`, `passport-ldapauth`, `dotenv`, `ldapjs`, `path`, `url`).
   - Loads environment variables using `dotenv`.

2. **Express App Setup**:

   - Creates an Express app.
   - Converts `import.meta.url` to `__dirname` equivalent.
   - Configures middleware: `body-parser` for parsing request bodies, `express-session` for session management, and `passport` for authentication.
   - Serves static files from the `public` directory.

3. **LDAP Strategy Configuration**:

   - Configures Passport's LDAP strategy using environment variables for LDAP server details.

4. **Passport Serialization/Deserialization**:

   - Defines how user information is stored in the session and retrieved from the session.

5. **Routes**:

   - **GET `/`**: Serves the `index.html` file.
   - **GET `/login`**: Serves the `login.html` file.
   - **POST `/login`**: Authenticates the user using Passport's LDAP strategy.
   - **GET `/login-success`**: Displays a success message if the user is authenticated.
   - **GET `/logout`**: Logs the user out and redirects to the home page.
   - **GET `/signup`**: Serves the `signup.html` file.
   - **POST `/signup`**: Handles user signup:
     - Binds to the LDAP server.
     - Searches for the highest `uidNumber`.
     - Creates a new LDAP entry for the user with a unique `uidNumber`.

6. **Server Setup**:
   - Starts the server on the specified port.

#### Example LDAP Entry

Here is an example of an LDAP entry that the code would work with:

##### User Entry

```
dn: uid=jdoe,ou=agents,dc=hyperdata,dc=it
uid: jdoe
cn: John Doe
sn: Doe
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: posixAccount
objectClass: shadowAccount
userPassword: {SSHA}5e -- GENERATE USING slappasswd --T3XKqkdPOmY/BfQ=
uidNumber: 1001
gidNumber: 1001
homeDirectory: /home/jdoe
loginShell: /bin/bash
```

#### Detailed Steps with Example

1. **User Authentication**:

   - User `jdoe` submits the login form with username `jdoe` and password `password123`.
   - Passport's LDAP strategy authenticates `jdoe` against the LDAP server.
   - If authentication succeeds, the user is logged in and redirected to `/login-success`.

2. **User Signup**:
   - User `jdoe` submits the signup form with username `jdoe` and password `password123`.
   - The LDAP client binds to the LDAP server using the bind DN and credentials.
   - The LDAP client searches for entries with `uidNumber` to find the highest existing `uidNumber`.
   - Assume the highest `uidNumber` found is `1000`.
   - A new `uidNumber` is calculated as `1001`.
   - A new LDAP entry is created for `jdoe` with the following attributes:
     - `uid: jdoe`
     - `cn: jdoe`
     - `sn: jdoe`
     - `objectClass: inetOrgPerson`, `posixAccount`, `shadowAccount`
     - `userPassword: password123` (hashed appropriately)
     - `uidNumber: 1001`
     - `gidNumber: 1001`
     - `homeDirectory: /home/jdoe`
     - `loginShell: /bin/bash`
   - The new entry is added to the LDAP directory.

#### Summary

The `app.js` file sets up an Express application with LDAP-based authentication and user signup functionality. It uses Passport's LDAP strategy for authentication and `ldapjs` for user creation. The example LDAP entry provided shows the structure of a user entry that the code would work with.
